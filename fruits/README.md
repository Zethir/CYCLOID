### What was challenging?

The testing with Jest was new to me so I would say that it was the most challenging

### What did you enjoy doing?

I enjoyed doing the general design of the app, adding tweaks and style like transitions or animations 

### If you had more time, what would you improve/do differently?

Probably the tests first of all.

And maybe add some functionnality to the views, like the possibility to delete a fruit on the fruit page or edit it. 

Or create a system to upload the photos on the server so it doesn't take to much time to load the images (can't do it without the possibility of editing existing fruits in the api).

And last but not least, refactor the components to be more modulable, more organised (tree like pattern)

### How much time (more or less) it took you to complete the task?I would say 10 hours, because I wanted to render beautiful views, I wanted it to be clean.

### What do you think about the task itself (was it a good experience? If not why?)

I learned some stuff a long the way so definitely a good experience. And I will definitely promote it as a front project I did
